# Loadable

Don't know how to handle network workðŸ“¶ properly in classes, how to separate between layers? Loadable is a simple set of classes that can help you handle it.

This is a simple solution that I like to use in my projects to alleviate a little thinking on how I should handle states with network work, and focus on what it is important, the logic to make the business logic work.
Upgraded it to be able to work with combine, I thought that was a good idea to make it public so anyone can use it, or get inspired on this and get with a better solution.

This is on a early stage, since its my first library, im gong to be tweaking the documentation, trying to make it as simple an easy I can do it.
