    // if we don't believe a loadable needs to sync every time.
    // This var also is intended to be overwritten,
    // if we desired to have a custom criteria in order to sync.

    // EG: in a loadable that has an array of Items we could override this to make it
    // needsSync { items.isEmpty }
    /// Var to control if needs to sync, logic starts with `state != .didSuccess`
    var needsSync: Bool { get }

    /// Try to sync no matter what.

    /// Notifies subscribers when a change has made to the loadable.
    func notifyDataDidChanged()

    /// Only notifies subscribers if the condition is pleased.
    func notifyDataDidChanged(if shouldNotify: Bool)

    // Not sure about this one, but its good to have all logic together,
    // if we need to do multiple things when this event happens
